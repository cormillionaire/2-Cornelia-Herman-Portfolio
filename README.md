# 2-Cornelia-Portfolio

## What this is
This is Cornelia Herman's Portfolio. It exmplifies my skillset to a potential employer.

### User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Usage
This is the beginning of a portfolio to show off what skills I've learned in the bootcamp and actually put to work. 
The first iteration of this encompasses advanced CSS as well as basic HTML. As I learn more, this will give opportunities to expand the functions of my portfolio.

Currently, there are place holders where the projects will be.

The header anchors navigate to the appropriate place on the page
It is responsive with built in breakpoints at 768 and 480. Around 280 is where its not really supported (will work but looks kinda weird). This was an intentional choice as its an edge case that someone would view at that width (or less).
